It\u2019s easy to set up and quick to learn how to play.  I find it\u2019s fun for about 20 min at each play.  The 7 year olds learned to be strategic very quickly.  The 5 year old enjoyed the game, but isn\u2019t a good loser.  We play best out of 5 or best out of 7.  The kids enjoy it, and it was something new to do, but not something they pick up and ask to play.  You need to be careful when putting it together, because the plastic pieces that make the game tower are easy to break.  The main drawback to this game is the box it comes in.  It doesn\u2019t fit the game once it\u2019s put together and there isn\u2019t anything to hold the coins.  I got plastic zip lock baggies to keep the red and yellow coins in, and just have to leave the box open.", "Endless Fun for the FamilyThe Hasbro Gaming Connect 4 Classic Grid has made our family time much more enjoyable.

He needs cognitive and dexterity and speech and physical therapy.  I read doing things of where he is at - helps to get the brain activated. If it is too hard they will get frustrated. So I started to look for cognitive puzzles and fun simple games that offer dexterity. And I learned shapes and numbers  also helps , aiming to relearn problem solving skills. So who ever visits can be engaged with him. He is out of state so it makes it harder. But recently one of the therapist said our son was way way beyond where they thought he would be when he first arrived at the high Intensisty rehab center. And prayers ....

The game arrived on time and was in perfect condition. My kids love playing this game together. From my experience, Amazon is always the best priced place to find this game.", "One of my favorite games growing up. The price was worth it.", "Initially the kids were simply putting the pieces into the slots at the top to fill up all spaces. After a few days though I was able to get them to choose a color and still they were simply filling all spaces. Hopefully the older one will start understanding the point of this game.

And at less than $6, it\u2019s 5 stars in my book.", "Fun and is just as described.", "So far, so good.  It's holding up, but it seems a bit lightweight.  One thing that annoys me is that the slide bar at the bottom to release the pieces after a game is over moves very, very easily.  Too easily IMO.  But it's serving my purpose of increasing fine motor skills for my young granddaughter.  She likes putting the pieces in the slots, but it will be another year probably before she understands the real goal.", "Love it", "A decent working and complete game of connect 4.... what more is there to say?Still fun half a century later.... thats a pretty glowing review I suppose.", "Reminder that game night can be simple and fun!", "I like the old colors better.", "Exactly what I thought it was", "Excelente juego , excelente precio !!!", "Great price and kids love it", "This was one of my favorite games growing up and I\u2019m happy I get to play it with my kids great for learning to count and developing critical thinking and strategy skills.

Great games.", "My 5 year old loves it.", "as usual, had this game ages ago and the stand broke...finally replaced the game.  The new one is now smaller than the older game but still a good price.", "\u00a0There are 3 PROS to the Hasbro Connect 4 Game:1. Though it\u2019s made of plastic, it is hard plastic and seems quite durable.2. You can modify the rules to even the playing field between parents and kids.3. The pieces are bright and easy to find (we don\u2019t believe in storing things in boxes.)The 3 CONS are:1. My preschooler is terrible at playing the standard game.2. It\u2019s too easy for him to just \u201cflip the board\u201d so to speak (by shifting the bottom lever and causing the pieces to fall.)3. I have to stay on top of my Connect 4 skills so he will never be able to beat me.My four-year-old son got a $25 Amazon gift card from one of his many grandmas so we took him on a cyber shopping spree. Connect 4 was one of his picks. I had to do a little assembly once it arrived, but it only took a couple minutes. I then tried to explain to him how to play, but he didn\u2019t really care for the rules, especially since I always go hard in the paint (and I expect him to do the same if he wants to get ahead in Trump\u2019s America.)Well, his constantly losing and acting out took its toll. I assure you I offered him encouraging words along the way and pointed out where he should stop me. But alas, the fun just wasn\u2019t there. So, like the government handing out our hard-earned dollars to multinational corporations, I modified the game so he would get to play twice for every single turn I took. This evened the playing field a bit.When my fingers are sore from hours of connecting, I tap out and Bucky has fun just making patterns with the pieces and board.Overall, I\u2019d say he\u2019s gotten his $8 of entertainment out of it in the last couple months. I give it five stars.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I\u2019m here to help!", "The best games are the classic ones like this! Always a family favorite!", "Good"]}
